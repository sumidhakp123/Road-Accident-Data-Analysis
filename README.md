# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
Made the dashboard interactive with the help of slicer and timeline connecting it via report connection.
I have analysed the data and created the dashboard in Excel.
I have used pivot table for analyzing.

Insights from data
1. Most casualties happened by vehicle - car ie. 80.42%.
2. Most casualties were not serious.
3. Most casualties happened on dry surface.
   
Here is the dataset for the same.
